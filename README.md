# My ReadMe App by Mukhesi Tshivhase

My experience with this setup proved challenging but I was able to manage to get through and got my setup to work.

Here are my steps to how I achieved this:

1. Enable the Text Function at the Import.

2. Enable the text by adding these <Text> and </Text> to the export default function app.

3. Write out the words to answer the instructions.

4. Check to see if the app is running with Expo Go

Here are the screenshots as proof that it works:
